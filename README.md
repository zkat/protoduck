[`protoduck`](https://github.com/zkat/protoduck) is a JavaScript library is a
library for making groups of methods, called "protocols".

If you're familiar with the concept of ["duck
typing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing), then it might make sense to
think of protocols as things that explicitly define what methods you need in
order to "clearly be a duck".

### Example

```javascript
const protoduck = require('protoduck')

// Quackable is a protocol that defines three methods
const Quackable = protoduck.define({
  walk: [],
  talk: [],
  isADuck: [() => true] // default implementation -- it's optional!
})

// `duck` must implement `Quackable` for this function to work. It doesn't
// matter what type or class duck is, as long as it implements Quackable.
function doStuffToDucks (duck) {
  if (!duck.isADuck()) {
    throw new Error('I want a duck!')
  } else {
    console.log(duck.walk())
    console.log(duck.talk())
  }
}

// ...In a different package:
const ducks = require('./ducks')

class Duck () {}

// Implement the protocol on the Duck class.
ducks.Quackable.impl(Duck, {
  walk () { return "*hobble hobble*" }
  talk () { return "QUACK QUACK" }
})

// main.js
ducks.doStuffToDucks(new Duck()) // works!
```

### Features

* Verifies implementations in case methods are missing or wrong ones added
* Helpful, informative error messages
* Optional default method implementations
* Fresh JavaScript Feelâ„¢ -- methods work just like native methods when called
* Methods can dispatch on arguments, not just `this` ([multimethods](https://npm.im/genfun))

### Guide

#### Introduction

JavaScript comes with its own method definition mechanism: You simply add
regular `function`s as properties to regular objects, and when you do
`obj.method()`, it calls the right code! ES6/ES2015 further extended this by
adding a `class` syntax that allowed this same system to work with more familiar
syntax sugar: `class Foo { method() { ... } }`.

`protoduck` is a similar *language extension*: it adds something called
"protocols" to JavaScript.

The purpose of protocols is to have a more explicit definitions of what methods
"go together". That is, if you have a type of task, you can group every method
that things definitely need to have under a protocol, and then write your code
using the methods defined there. The assumption is that anything that defines
that group of methods will work with the rest of your code.

And then you can export the protocol itself, and tell your users "if you
implement this protocol for your own objects, they'll work with my code."

Duck typing is a common term for this: If it walks like a duck, and it talks
like a duck, then it may as well be a duck, as far as any of our code is
concerned.

Many other languages have similar or identical concepts under different names:
Java's interfaces, Haskell's typeclasses, Rust's traits. Elixir and Clojure both
call them "protocols" as well. It's a really handy abstraction!

#### Defining Protocols

The first step to using `protoduck` is to define a protocol. Protocol
definitions look like this:

```javascript
// import the library first!
const protoduck = require('protoduck')

// `Ducklike` is the name of our protocol. It defines what it means for
// something to be "like a duck", as far as our code is concerned.
const Ducklike = protoduck.define([], {
  walk: [], // This says that the protocol requires a "walk" method.
  talk: [] // and ducks also need to talk
  peck: [] // and they can even be pretty scary
})
```

Protocols by themselves don't really *do* anything, they simply define what
methods are included in the protocol, and thus what will need to be implemented.

#### Protocol Impls

The simplest type of definitions for protocols are as regular methods. In this
style, protocols end up working exactly like normal JavaScript methods: they're
added as properties of the target type/object, and we call them using the
`foo.method()` syntax. `this` is accessible inside the methods, as usual.

Implementation syntax is very similar to protocol definitions, using `.impl`:

```javascript
class Dog {}

// Implementing `Ducklike` for `Dog`s
Ducklike.impl(Dog, [], {
  walk () { return '*pads on all fours*' }
  talk () { return 'woof woof. I mean "quack" >_>' }
  peck (victim) { return 'Can I just bite ' + victim + ' instead?...' }
})
```

So now, our `Dog` class has two extra methods: `walk`, and `talk`, and we can
just call them:

```javascript
const pupper = new Dog()

pupper.walk() // *pads on all fours*
pupper.talk() // woof woof. I mean "quack" >_>
pupper.peck('this string') // Can I just bite this string instead?...
```

#### Multiple Dispatch

You may have noticed before that we have these `[]` in various places that don't
seem to have any obvious purpose.

These arrays allow protocols to be implemented not just for a single value of
`this`, but across *all arguments*. That is, you can have methods in these
protocols that use both `this`, and the first argument (or any other arguments)
in order to determine what code to actually execute.

This type of method is called a multimethod, and is one of the differences
between protoduck and the default `class` syntax.

To use it: in the protocol *definitions*, you put matching
strings in different spots where those empty arrays were, and when you
*implement* the protocol, you give the definition the actual types/objects you
want to implement it on, and it takes care of mapping types to the strings you
defined, and making sure the right code is run:

```javascript
const Playful = protoduck.define(['friend'], {// <---\
  playWith: ['friend'] // <------------ these correspond to each other
})

class Cat {}
class Human {}
class Dog {}

// The first protocol is for Cat/Human combination
Playful.impl(Cat, [Human], {
  playWith (human) {
    return '*headbutt* *purr* *cuddle* omg ilu, ' + human.name
  }
})

// And we define it *again* for a different combination
Playful.impl(Cat, [Dog], {
  playWith (dog) {
    return '*scratches* *hisses* omg i h8 u, ' + dog.name
  }
})

// depending on what you call it with, it runs different methods:
const cat = new Cat()
const human = new Human()
const dog = new Dog()

cat.playWith(human) // *headbutt* *purr* *cuddle* omg ilu, Sam
cat.playWith(dog) // *scratches* *hisses* omg i h8 u, Pupper
```

### API

#### <a name="define"></a> `define(<types>?, <spec>, <opts>)`

Defines a new protocol on across arguments of types defined by `<types>`, which
will expect implementations for the functions specified in `<spec>`.

If `<types>` is missing, it will be treated the same as if it were an empty
array.

The types in `<spec>` entries must map, by string name, to the type names
specified in `<types>`, or be an empty array if `<types>` is omitted. The types
in `<spec>` will then be used to map between method implementations for the
individual functions, and the provided types in the impl.

Protocols can include an `opts` object as the last argument, with the following
available options:

* `opts.name` `{String}` - The name to use when referring to the protocol.

* `opts.metaobject` - Accepts an object implementing the
  `Protoduck` protocol, which can be used to alter protocol definition
  mechanisms in `protoduck`.

##### Example

```javascript
const Eq = protoduck.define(['a'], {
  eq: ['a']
})
```

#### <a name="impl"></a> `proto.impl(<target>, <types>?, <implementations>?)`

Adds a new implementation to the given protocol across `<types>`.

`<implementations>` must be an object with functions matching the protocol's
API. If given, the types in `<types>` will be mapped to their corresponding
method arguments according to the original protocol definition.

If a protocol is derivable -- that is, all its functions have default impls,
then the `<implementations>` object can be omitted entirely, and the protocol
will be automatically derived for the given `<types>`

##### Example

```javascript
import protoduck from 'protoduck'

// Singly-dispatched protocols
const Show = protoduck.define({
  show: []
})

class Foo {
  constructor (name) {
    this.name = name
  }
}

Show.impl(Foo, {
  show () { return `[object Foo(${this.name})]` }
})

const f = new Foo('alex')
f.show() === '[object Foo(alex)]'
```

```javascript
import protoduck from 'protoduck'

// Multi-dispatched protocols
const Comparable = protoduck.define(['target'], {
  compare: ['target'],
})

class Foo {}
class Bar {}
class Baz {}

Comparable.impl(Foo, [Bar], {
  compare (bar) { return 'bars are ok' }
})

Comparable.impl(Foo, [Baz], {
  compare (baz) { return 'but bazzes are better' }
})

const foo = new Foo()
const bar = new Bar()
const baz = new Baz()

foo.compare(bar) // 'bars are ok'
foo.compare(baz) // 'but bazzes are better'
```
