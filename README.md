[`protoduck`](https://github.com/zkat/protoduck) is a JavaScript library
for making groups of methods, called "protocols", that work together to
provide some abstract functionality that other things can then rely on. If
you're familiar with the concept of ["duck
typing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing), then it might make sense to
think of protocols as things that explicitly define what methods you need in
order to "clearly be a duck".

On top of providing a nice, clear interface for defining these protocols, this
module gives clear, useful errors when implementations are missing something or doing
something wrong.

One thing that sets this library apart from others is that on top of defining
duck-typed protocols on a single class/type, it lets you have different
implementations depending on the _arguments_. So a method on `Foo` may call
different code dependent on whether its first _argument_ is `Bar` or `Baz`. If
you've ever wished a method worked differently for different types of things
passed to it, this does that!

### Example

```javascript
import protocol from "protoduck"

// Quackable is a protocol that defines three methods
const Quackable = protocol({
  walk: [],
  talk: [],
  isADuck: [() => true] // default implementation -- it's optional!
})

// `duck` must implement `Quackable` for this function to work. It doesn't
// matter what type or class duck is, as long as it implements Quackable.
function doStuffToDucks (duck) {
  if (!duck.isADuck()) {
    throw new Error('I want a duck!')
  } else {
    console.log(duck.walk())
    console.log(duck.talk())
  }
}

// and another place...
class Duck () {}

// Implement the protocol on the Duck class.
Quackable(Duck, [], {
  walk() { return "*hobble hobble*" }
  talk() { return "QUACK QUACK" }
})

// main.js
doStuffToDucks(new Duck()) // works!
```

### Features

### Guide

#### Introduction

JavaScript comes with its own method definition mechanism: You simply add
regular `function`s as properties to regular objects, and when you do
`obj.method()`, it calls the right code! ES6/ES2015 further extended this by
adding a `class` syntax that allowed this same system to work with more familiar
syntax sugar: `class Foo { method() { ... } }`.

`protoduck` is a similar *language extension*: it adds something called
"protocols" to JavaScript.

The purpose of protocols is to have a more explicit definitions of what methods
"go together". That is, if you have a type of task, you can group every method
that things definitely need to have under a protocol, and then write your code
using the methods defined there. The assumption is that anything that defines
that group of methods will work with the rest of your code.

Then you can export the protocol itself, and tell your users "if you
implement this protocol for your own objects, they'll work with my code."

Duck typing is a common term for this: If it walks like a duck, and it talks
like a duck, then it may as well be a duck, as far as any of our code is
concerned.

#### Defining Protocols

The first step to using `protoduck` is to define a protocol. Protocol
definitions look like this:

```javascript
// import the library first!
import protocol from "protoduck"

// `Ducklike` is the name of our protocol. It defines what it means for
// something to be "like a duck", as far as our code is concerned.
const Ducklike = protocol([], {
  walk: [], // This says that the protocol requires a "walk" method.
  talk: [] // and ducks also need to talk
  peck: [] // and they can even be pretty scary
})
```

Protocols by themselves don't really *do* anything, they simply define what
methods are included in the protocol, and thus what will need to be implemented.

#### Simple impls

The simplest type of definitions for protocols are as regular methods. In this
style, protocols end up working exactly like normal JavaScript methods: they're
added as properties of the target type/object, and we call them using the
`foo.method()` syntax. `this` is accessible inside the methods, as usual.

Implementation syntax is very similar to protocol definitions, but it calls the
protocol itself, instead of `protocol`. It also refers to the type that you want
to implement it *on*:

```javascript
class Dog {}

// Implementing `Ducklike` for `Dog`s
Ducklike(Dog, [], {
  walk() { return '*pads on all fours*' }
  talk() { return 'woof woof. I mean "quack" >_>' }
  peck(victim) { return 'Can I just bite ' + victim + ' instead?...' }
})
```

So now, our `Dog` class has two extra methods: `walk`, and `talk`, and we can
just call them:

```javascript
const pupper = new Dog()

pupper.walk() // *pads on all fours*
pupper.talk() // woof woof. I mean "quack" >_>
pupper.peck('this string') // Can I just bite this string instead?...
```

#### Multiple Dispatch

You may have noticed before that we have these `[]` in various places that don't
seem to have any obvious purpose. 

These arrays allow protocols to be implemented not just for a single value of
`this`, but across *all arguments*. That is, you can have methods in these
protocols that use both `this`, and the first argument (or any other arguments)
in order to determine what code to actually execute.

This type of method is called a multimethod, and isn't a core JavaScript
feature. It's something that sets `protoduck` apart, and it can be really
useful!

The way to use it is simple: in the protocol *definitions*, you put matching
strings in different spots where those empty arrays were, and when you
*implement* the protocol, you give the definition the actual types/objects you
want to implement it on, and it takes care of mapping types to the strings you
defined, and making sure the right code is run:

```javascript
const Playable = protocol(['friend'], {
  playWith: ['friend']
})

class Cat {}
class Human {}
class Dog {}

// The first protocol is for Cat/Human combination
Playable(Cat, [Human], {
  playWith(human) {
    return '*headbutt* *purr* *cuddle* omg ilu, ' + human.name
  }
})

// And we define it *again* for a different combination
Playable(Cat, [Dog], {
  playWith(dog) {
    return '*scratches* *hisses* omg i h8 u, ' + dog.name
  }
})

// depending on what you call it with, it runs different methods:
const cat = new Cat()
const human = new Human()
const dog = new Dog()

cat.playWith(human) // *headbutt* *purr* *cuddle* omg ilu, Sam
cat.playWith(dog) // *scratches* *hisses* omg i h8 u, Pupper
```

In general, most implementations you write won't care what types their arguments
are, but when you do? This may end up saving you a lot of trouble and allowing
some tricks you might realize you can do that weren't possible before!

#### Static impls

Finally, there's a type of protocol impl that doesn't involve a `this` value at
all: static impls. Some languages might call them "class methods". In
the case of `protoduck`, though, these static methods exist on the protocol
object itself, rather than a regular JavaScript class.

Static methods can be really useful when you want to call them as plain old
functions without having to worry about the `this` value. Because
`protoduck` supports multiple dispatch, it means you can get full method
functionality, but with regular functions that don't need `this`: they just
operate on their standard arguments.

Static impls are easy to make: omit the first object type and use the
arguments array to define what the methods will be implemented on:

```javascript
const Eq = protocol(['a', 'b'], {
  equals: ['a', 'b']
})

const equals = Eq.equals // This isn't necessary, but it shows that we
                         // don't need a `.` to call them, at all!

Eq([Number, Number], {
  equals(x, y) {
    return x === y
  }
})

Eq([Cat, Cat], {
  equals(kitty, cat) {
    return kitty.name === cat.name
  }
})

equals(1, 1) // true
equals(1, 2) // false
equals(snookums, reika) // false
equals(walter, walter) // true
equals(1, snookums) // Error! No protocol impl!
```

### API

#### <a name="protocol"></a> `protocol(<types>?, <spec>, <opts>)`

Defines a new protocol on across arguments of types defined by `<types>`, which
will expect implementations for the functions specified in `<spec>`.

If `<types>` is missing, it will be treated the same as if it were an empty
array.

The types in `<spec>` must map, by string name, to the type names specified in
`<types>`, or be an empty array if `<types>` is omitted. The types in `<spec>`
will then be used to map between method implementations for the individual
functions, and the provided types in the impl.

Protocols can include an `opts` object as the last argument, with the following
available options:

* `opts.private` `{Boolean=false}` - if true, method-style definitions will not
  add the methods by name to the target object. Implementation methods can still
  be accessed by using `<obj>[<protocol>.<methName>.symbol]`. This will make
  implementations usable for internals without potential name conflicts.

* `opts.metaobject` `{Protocol.meta}` - Accepts an object implementing the
  `Protocol.meta` protocol, which can be used to alter protocol definition
  mechanisms in `protoduck`.

##### Example

```javascript
const Eq = protocol(['a', 'b'], {
  eq: ['a', 'b']
})
```

#### <a name="impl"></a> `proto(<target>?, <types>?, <implementations>)`

Adds a new implementation to the given `proto` across `<types>`.

`<implementations>` must be an object with functions matching the protocol's
API. The types in `<types>` will be used for defining specific methods using
the function as the body.

Protocol implementations must include either `<target>`, `<types>`, or both:

* If only `<target>` is present, implementations will be defined the same as
  "traditional" methods -- that is, the definitions in `<implementations>`
  will add function properties directly to `<target>`.

* If only `<types>` is present, the protocol will keep all protocol functions as
  "static" methods on the protocol itself.

* If both are specified, protocol implementations will add methods to the `<target>`, and define multimethods using `<types>`.

If a protocol is derivable -- that is, all its functions have default impls,
then the `<implementations>` object can be omitted entirely, and the protocol
will be automatically derived for the given `<types>`

##### Example

```javascript
import protocol from 'protoduck'

// Singly-dispatched protocols
const Show = protocol({
  show: []
})

class Foo {}

Show(Foo, {
  show () { return `[object Foo(${this.name})]` }
})

var f = new Foo()
f.name = 'alex'
f.show() === '[object Foo(alex)]'
```

```javascript
import protocol from 'protoduck'

// Multi-dispatched protocols
const Comparable = protocol(['target'], {
  compare: ['target'],
})

class Foo {}
class Bar {}
class Baz {}

Comparable(Foo, [Bar], {
  compare (bar) { return 'bars are ok' }
})

Comparable(Foo, [Baz], {
  compare (baz) { return 'but bazzes are better' }
})

const foo = new Foo()
const bar = new Bar()
const baz = new Baz()

foo.compare(bar) // 'bars are ok'
foo.compare(baz) // 'but bazzes are better'
```
